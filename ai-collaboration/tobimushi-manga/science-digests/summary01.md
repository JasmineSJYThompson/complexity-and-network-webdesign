**Title:** Collembola-mediated fungal dispersal and microbial network stability

### Key Insights:
- Collembola (トビムシ) selectively feed on fungi and help regulate microbial community dynamics.
- Their mobility enables fungal spore dispersal and contributes to microbial network resilience.
- Mycorrhizal fungal networks act as communication and nutrient-sharing channels among plants.
- Environmental stressors like drought or tillage can disrupt these networks, leading to ecosystem-level instability.

### Story Relevance:
- The disappearance of "菌の声" in the story represents the collapse of a mycorrhizal network.
- トビノ’s role as a mobile, fungi-interacting organism makes him a symbolic “mediator” or “responder” to ecosystem crises.
