## ðŸŽ¨ Character: Tobino

**Filename:** `tobino.png`  
**Description:**  
Tobino is a young, somewhat fragile springtail (Collembola) who begins his journey after the fungal network falls silent.  
This image captures the moment where he stands alone, uncertain but quietly determined to seek out new connections in the darkened soil world.

**Prompt used:**

> A small, slightly fragile-looking springtail (Collembola) character with a translucent segmented body, long sensitive antennae, and large moist eyes that reflect uncertainty and curiosity.  
> It stands alone on damp soil with faded fungal threads in the background.  
> Soft ambient lighting. Stylized but emotionally expressive illustration, evoking the feeling of a lost child in a vast underground forest.
