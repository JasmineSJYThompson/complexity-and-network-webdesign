## 🔁 Four-Layer Loop Structure

1. 🧠 **構想層** – Human creators write story concepts, characters, metaphors.
2. 🧪 **科学層** – Real ecological and microbiological studies are referenced and summarized.
3. 🤖 **AI支援層** – GPT and image models co-generate drafts and visual ideas.
4. 🛠 **構造層** – Developers build interactive viewers and data tools to present the content.

These layers form a creative ecosystem: scientific knowledge becomes story, AI supports imagination, and OSS codifies the results into an expandable archive.
