# Shrine-Fiction Project 🏞️🧠💋

Shrine-Fiction is an open cultural-scientific storytelling project that reimagines Japan's ancient landscape through the lens of **geography, watersheds, and shrine networks**.
It is built upon the idea that **shrines are not isolated religious sites**, but cultural nodes rooted in terrain, springs, water systems, and human settlements.

## 🌐 Core Concept

> "**Terrain × Watershed × Shrine Placement × Storytelling**"
> From detailed field observations to fictional storytelling, Shrine-Fiction builds a layered structure that blends material reality with mythic imagination.

This project operates in **four iterative layers**, integrating fieldwork, documentation, narrative design, and open publication. A supplementary loop called **ZUKAN** supports the collection and classification of shrine parts, enabling comparative analysis.

## 🧱 Components

* **Shrine Parts ZUKAN**: A digital illustrated index of torii, komainu, honden, stone tablets, and more.
* **Field Notes**: Observation records from real shrines with terrain analysis (e.g., spring locations, escarpments, lost pathways).
* **Narrative Fragments**: Mythic or speculative fiction grounded in shrine-geography networks.
* **Data + Story Fusion**: Network science meets folklore. Reality-based fiction.
