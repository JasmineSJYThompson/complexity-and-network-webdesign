# ðŸ§  CANW Glossary

Welcome to the **CANW (Complexity And Network Webdesign)** glossary.
This document defines core terms and concepts used across the project to help align understanding among contributors, designers, and developers.

## ðŸŒ± Core Concepts

### Complexity
A system characterized by many interacting parts, where the whole exhibits properties that the parts alone do not. Complexity is often nonlinear, adaptive, and difficult to predict.

### Emergence
The spontaneous appearance of patterns, structures, or behaviors in a complex system, often from simple local rules or interactions.

### Network
A structure made of nodes (entities) and edges (connections) representing relationships, flows, or influences within a system.

### Swarm Intelligence
A type of collective behavior arising from decentralized, self-organized systems, often seen in nature (e.g. ants, birds) and modeled in AI.

### Rhizome
Borrowed from plant biology and Deleuzian theory, a rhizome is a non-hierarchical, interconnected structure â€” used here to describe non-linear, non-centralized web systems.

### Mycelium
The root-like structure of fungi, representing a living network of resource-sharing â€” metaphorically central to CANWâ€™s biological inspiration.

## ðŸŽ¨ Cultural and Design Terms

### Emaki (çµµå·»)
Japanese picture scrolls that unfold horizontally, combining text and images into continuous narratives. Influential in CANWâ€™s visual storytelling approach.

### Scroll Narrative
A form of web-based visual storytelling that mimics the unfolding nature of Emaki or digital comics.

### Interactivity
The quality of a system that allows users to engage, explore, and influence it â€” a key feature of CANW interfaces.

### Generative Design
Designs created or co-created by algorithms, AI models, or procedural rules. Embraced in CANW for emergent and collaborative creativity.

## ðŸ§° Technical Terms

### RDB (Relational Database)
A structured database model where data is stored in tables and relationships are defined between entities. CANW explores how to transform RDB data into networks.

### JSON / CSV
Common data formats used for storing structured information. Often used in CANW to load or visualize datasets.

### NetworkX
A Python library for creating, analyzing, and visualizing networks. Used in CANWâ€™s data and fungi network experiments.

### TensorFlow.js
A JavaScript library for machine learning in the browser. Used in CANWâ€™s interactive demos and AI experiments.
