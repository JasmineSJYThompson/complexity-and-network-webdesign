# 🗺️ CANW Roadmap

Welcome to the evolving roadmap for **CANW (Complexity And Network Webdesign)** — a living, open-ended project that grows through collaboration, experimentation, and emergence.

This roadmap outlines short-term priorities, long-term visions, and open invitations for contribution. It is meant to guide without limiting, and to offer a shared sense of direction for everyone involved.

## 🚀 Phase 1 – Laying the Foundation *(Now → Q2 2025)*

**Goals:**
- ✅ Launch the GitHub repository and community structure
- ✅ Define concepts, contribution flow, and initial documentation
- ✅ Publish basic website via `site/` using Next.js or Astro
- ✅ Create initial `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and glossary
- 🚧 Draft first subproject READMEs (Emaki, RDB-to-Network, TF.js Playground)
- 🚧 Open project discussions and seed ideas

**Participation Welcome:**
- Improve docs and onboarding
- Share project ideas via Issues or Discussions
- Try out early experiments and give feedback

## 🌿 Phase 2 – Creative Growth *(Q3 2025 → Q1 2026)*

**Goals:**
- ✨ Develop MVPs for key subprojects:
  - Emaki viewer with horizontal scroll and navigation
  - Fungi/Network visualization from RDB via NetworkX
  - AI demos using TensorFlow.js
- ✨ Design and test complexity-aware UI components
- ✨ Launch community-driven blog / showcase via site/
- 📈 Refine docs, roadmap, and glossary collaboratively

**Participation Welcome:**
- Join subproject teams
- Help prototype or test interfaces
- Write blog posts, tutorials, or visual guides

## 🌌 Phase 3 – Emergent Systems *(2026 and beyond)*

**Aspirations:**
- Build a web-native framework for expressing complexity visually and interactively
- Introduce spatial/temporal metaphors (scrolling, maps, timelines)
- Collaborate with artists, researchers, and educators across disciplines
- Support multilingual content and global participation

**Dreams:**
- "Scroll the world" — global Emaki-style narratives
- "Network the unseen" — reveal hidden cultural or biological connections
- "Collaborate with AI" — co-creative workflows for storytelling, modeling, and design
