## 🧩 Coming Soon

We are actively working on these documents:

- `roadmap.md`: Laying out phases and priority areas across subprojects
- `glossary.md`: Defining key terms like "emergence", "mycelium", and "scroll narrative"
- `new_project_proposal.md`: A template to make it easy for anyone to propose a new project idea

If you'd like to help shape them, open a [Discussion](https://github.com/your-repo/discussions) or contribute directly.

Let’s grow this creative network together 🌱
