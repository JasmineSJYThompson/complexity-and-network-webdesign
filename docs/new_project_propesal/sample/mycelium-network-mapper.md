# 🆕 New Project Proposal

**Mycelium Network Mapper（菌糸ネットワーク・マッパー）**

---

## 📌 Project Title

**Mycelium Network Mapper**

> A visual and interactive way to explore fungal mycelium networks based on real-world data and ecological models.

---

## 🌱 Summary

> This project aims to model and visualize fungal mycelium networks using biological principles and network science. It will allow users to upload or browse data (e.g., forest samples, simulations) and explore how fungi optimize connections in nature.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Visualize growth patterns of fungal networks
- Explore efficiency vs resilience trade-offs
- Allow dataset uploads in JSON/CSV format
- Compare simulated and real-world fungal graphs

---

## 🧩 Alignment with CANW

> This project is directly aligned with CANW’s **Biological** theme and supports the **Emergent** aspect through algorithmic modeling. The interface also draws from **Cultural** patterns like root-map diagrams found in historical Japanese scrolls.
