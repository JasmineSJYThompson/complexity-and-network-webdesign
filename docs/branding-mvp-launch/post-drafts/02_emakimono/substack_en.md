## #2 Emakimono Viewer — A Flowing Cultural Interface for the Web

### Introduction: Was Culture Always Meant to Flow?

Modern UI conventions present us with a fragmented world: click, list, feed.
But what if cultural transmission was once far more fluid and continuous?

Take the _emakimono_, or traditional Japanese picture scroll. Unlike turning pages, these scrolls are unrolled horizontally, inviting the viewer to _follow_ a scene rather than flip through it. Space, time, relationships, and events are layered into a single flowing landscape.

To view an emakimono is not simply to "read" it, but to immerse oneself in a story that slowly unfurls from right to left. Like watching a silent animation, one unrolls the scroll gradually, allowing the narrative to appear and disappear through motion.

### What Is the Emakimono Viewer?

The Emakimono Viewer is an attempt to reimagine cultural expression through a **horizontal-scroll UI** inspired by traditional Japanese scrolls. It aims to:

- Unite space and time into a single continuous scrollable experience
- Avoid hard scene breaks, favoring a smooth visual flow
- Embed characters, events, and topography into a seamless narrative terrain

In reality, few people ever handle physical emakimono. Even in books or exhibitions, they are shown only in fragments. Online, they’re typically presented as vertical lists or static thumbnails. The original experience of _unrolling_ is lost.

That’s why we’re using horizontal scroll on the web to recreate the immersive logic of the emakimono.

Rather than freezing culture in static form, this interface invites re-experience through **nonlinear, exploratory movement**.

This project is also part of CANW (Complexity And Network Webdesign), and exists as an **independent OSS repository** on GitHub:

> Project: _Emakimono Viewer_ — Explore traditional picture scrolls through interactive horizontal flow.
>
> - Open to both coders and non-coders
> - Contributions welcome for scroll data, annotations, translations, or UI refinement

Currently featured scrolls include:

- 🐸 _Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga_ (Animal-person Caricature Scrolls)
- 💀 _Kusōzuzu_ (Nine Stages of a Decaying Corpse)

These scrolls are often shown only in fragments, even in education. Here, you can follow them _as if watching an animated tale_, from end to end.

### Why Horizontal Scroll Now?

Most of today’s web is built on vertical scrolling.
But for ecosystems, river basins, stories, seasons, and kinship networks—**horizontal flow may be more natural.**

- Like emakimono, time flows along the shape of terrain
- As space shifts, relationships morph
- Sequence is flexible; speed and direction affect experience

To reintroduce this nonlinear, embodied way of experiencing, Emakimono Viewer revives the scroll as **a gesture-based interface**.

### Technical Stack and Development Outlook

- Lightweight frontend: Next.js + TypeScript
- Canvas-based rendering expansion with PixiJS (in development)
- Flexible data structure: JSON / CSV annotations
- Data backend (planned): Supabase
- Open contribution model via GitHub for assets, data, and layouts

Currently, we focus on two works for simplicity and clarity. The project is now being **refactored for OSS**, with plans to:

- Upgrade TypeScript integration and Next.js version
- Improve scroll data architecture (JSON, Supabase)
- Add thumbnails, navigation overlays, and indicators
- Expand collections by theme or geography

### Conclusion: Culture as Interface

The Emakimono Viewer is more than a viewer.
It is a design response to a question core to CANW:

**How can UI express relationships, memory, and complexity in a culturally grounded way?**

It lets time drift, space bleed, and relationships surface gently.
It is not just an archive. It is a new scroll for future cultural memory.

Next time, we’ll introduce how "From RDB to Network" translates data into webs of relation.
