📜 What if time flowed sideways—on the web?

In Japanese emakimono (picture scrolls), the story doesn't flip pages—it unfolds horizontally.

As you scroll, time expands like a landscape.
Space and narrative blur.

At CANW, we’re rebuilding this experience digitally with the Emakimono Viewer, an open-source horizontal-scroll interface for cultural archives.

🖼️ The UI is designed to mirror the fluid continuity of traditional emakimono—no hard cuts, no chapters, just flow.

Our current prototypes include:

🐸 Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga (Animal caricatures)

💀 Kusōzu (Nine Stages of a Decaying Corpse)
