🤖 What if AI wasn't a tool—but a collaborator in storytelling?

At CANW, we’re exploring how generative AI can help reconstruct ancient ecologies, mythic worlds, and speculative futures—not as a writer, but as a co-imaginer.

Our experiments include:

📘 Jomon Fiction: Reimagining prehistoric life with terrain, plants, and pottery as narrative anchors

⛩ Shrine Fiction: Myths shaped by spring water, shrines, and watershed geographies

🦠 Tobimushi Manga: A microbial sci-fi from the perspective of soil fauna and fungi

We don’t ask AI to “write for us.”
We build with it—through prompts, responses, and shared ambiguity.

If you’re curious about AI, networks, and emergent culture, we’d love to hear from you.
