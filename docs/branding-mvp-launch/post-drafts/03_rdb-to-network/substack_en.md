## #3 Evolving Network MVP — From RDB to Network

### 🧬 The Problem: Structured but Not Connected

Many cultural archives and ecological datasets are organized in formats like CSV or relational databases (RDBs).
These formats are clean and logical, but often lack intuitive visibility into how things **connect**.

Tables and IDs make data structured, but they frequently obscure the actual **relationships** between elements.

CANW explores how to recompose such structured data by **visualizing it as a network of relationships**.

### 🔄 Project Overview: From RDB to Network

"From RDB to Network" is an experimental toolchain that uses Python (pandas + NetworkX) to turn relational data into visual networks.

At first glance, disjointed CSVs or SQL tables may seem unrelated. But by reframing them through relationships, we can recompose them as **bundles of meaning**.

The transformation from table to network **is itself the story** of this project.

Current prototypes explore:

- 🍄 **Fungi Network**

  - Models fungal structures as CSV-based networks and visualizes their hyphal growth.

- ⛩ **Shrine Network**

  - Connects shrines by shared deities and regional arrangements (e.g., along river basins).

- 🐜 **Soil Fauna Network**

  - Reconstructs microbial and animal interactions (e.g., predation, co-occurrence) in soil ecosystems.

### 🧠 Design Philosophy: From Structure to Sensing

This project isn't just about managing data.
It's about **feeling invisible relations through data**.

> Can we move from "data as structure" to "data as atmosphere"?
> Can a network visualization carry the _presence_ or _hint_ of relational life?

Facts buried in relational schemas begin to pulse like biological networks when viewed as graphs.
It becomes less about computation and more like tracing the mycelium beneath the forest floor.

### 🛠 Tech Stack and OSS Development

From RDB to Network is open to developers, researchers, and field observers alike. If you're curious about **visualizing connections**, we invite you to contribute.

The stack is currently built on Python with:

- Entity-relation CSVs
- Attribute-rich nodes and labeled edges
- Layouts based on **spatial logic**, not random placement

All source code and documentation will be published and maintained here:

### 🔀 Closing Thought: Networks as Sensed Webs

Relational data accumulates every day—in culture, ecology, and beyond.
But exploring **how** things connect moves us from data curation to **world-making**.

From RDB to Network is just the MVP.
It will soon integrate with CANW’s broader network infrastructure to visualize interrelations across fungi, shrines, river basins, ecosystems, and narratives.

Next up: a look into AI Collaboration and generative fiction layers.
