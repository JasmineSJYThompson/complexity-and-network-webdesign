🧩 What if we could feel relationships in data—not just manage them?

Spreadsheets and relational databases are great at structure—but poor at intuition.

At CANW, we’re experimenting with converting relational data (RDB, CSV) into living network graphs—to express complexity as ecology, topology, or memory.

👉 From RDB to Network is an open-source toolchain built with Python (pandas + NetworkX).

Current applications:

🍄 Fungi Network: Hyphal structures modeled from CSV

⛩ Shrine Network: Connecting shrines by rivers, deities, and landscapes

🐜 Soil Fauna Network: Mapping interspecies relations underground

This isn’t just data visualization—it’s network-based storytelling.
