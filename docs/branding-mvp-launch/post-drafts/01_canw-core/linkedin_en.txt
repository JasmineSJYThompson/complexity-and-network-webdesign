🧭 What happens when we stop simplifying complexity?

At CANW (Complexity And Network Webdesign), we’re designing systems that don’t flatten or abstract, but instead express complexity as it is—through structure, landscape, and story.

🌊 What if shrines and ruins formed edges that narrate the river basin as a living network?
📜 What if horizontal scrolls let us feel time as nonlinear flow?
🍄 What if fungal and soil fauna networks could be visualized and explored?
🤖 What if AI became a collaborator in telling complex, emergent stories?

CANW is an evolving ecosystem of open-source tools and story-driven experiments, ranging from shrine networks to AI co-authored fiction.

👉 We just published our first article:
“What is CANW? — Expressing Complexity Without Reduction”

Let’s imagine, build, and walk nonlinear systems together.
