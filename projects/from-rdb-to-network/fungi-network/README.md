(https://colab.research.google.com/github/satoshi-create/complexity-and-network-webdesign/blob/main/projects/from-rdb-to-network/fungi-network/notebooks/fungi-network.ipynb)

This project explores the structure and growth of fungal mycelium networks using simple ecological graph models.

## 📊 Goals

- Visualize fungal networks as interactive or static graphs
- Experiment with different network topologies (grid, random, etc.)
- Prepare JSON/CSV/RDB datasets and enable data-driven visualization

## 📂 Structure

- `data/`: Sample network datasets
- `scripts/`: Python scripts using NetworkX
- `notebooks/`: Colab-friendly exploration notebooks

> Fungal networks show us that intelligence isn’t centralized — it’s distributed, adaptive, and relational.
