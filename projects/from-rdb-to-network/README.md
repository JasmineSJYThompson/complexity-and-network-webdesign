## 🧠 Concept

Relational Databases (RDBs) have long served as the backbone of digital systems.  
They organize products, users, records — structured, normalized, indexed.

But for many of us, especially those coming from creative, cultural, or biological perspectives,  
RDBs feel rigid. Cold. Even lifeless.

What if we could reimagine RDBs not as shelves or storage units,  
but as **starting points for dynamic, living networks**?

This project is an invitation to shift our thinking —  
from static rows and columns to organic webs of relationships.  
From "data as inventory" to **data as ecology**.

---

## 🤔 Why This Matters

Many learners feel alienated by traditional RDBs:
- "Too technical."
- "Too abstract."
- "Not flexible enough for the real world."

But behind every table is a **network waiting to emerge**:
- Users relate to users (social graphs)
- Books relate to topics (knowledge graphs)
- Microbes relate to soil (ecological networks)

By tracing relationships beyond the schema,  
we find the **connective tissue** that powers complexity, learning, and insight.

## 🚶‍♀️ The Journey

`from-RDB-to-Network` is a hands-on, experimental project that follows this path:

1. **Design**: Build traditional ER diagrams and schemas using drawSQL or similar tools
2. **Structure**: Store data in Supabase / PostgreSQL
3. **Transform**: Convert structured data into graph formats (edge/node)
4. **Visualize**: Use NetworkX, Neo4j, and D3.js to bring the network to life
5. **Reflect**: Understand what changes when we see the same data as a network

## 🌱 What You Can Learn Here

- How to design and normalize a relational schema
- How to extract and reshape data into graphs
- How to visualize relationships dynamically
- How data changes meaning depending on the lens we use

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, Supabase
- **Visualization**: drawSQL, NetworkX, Neo4j, D3.js
- **Languages**: Python, TypeScript (planned)
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebooks, CSV, JSON, ERD diagrams

## ✨ Who This Is For

- Learners who find RDBs too abstract, but love systems thinking
- Creatives who want to work with data in intuitive, visual ways
- Biologists, designers, philosophers, and network nerds
- Anyone who believes structure is just the beginning

Let’s rethink what data can be.  
Let’s go from rigid structures… to living networks.
