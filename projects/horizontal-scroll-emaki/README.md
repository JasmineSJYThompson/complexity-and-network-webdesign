# 📜 Horizontal Scroll Emaki

An experimental frontend project inspired by traditional Japanese emakimono (picture scrolls), reimagined as a horizontal scrolling web experience.

## 🎨 Origin: 横スクロールで楽しむ絵巻物

This project originated from an ongoing web-based experiment:

📂 GitHub：
👉 [satoshi-create/emakimono-next](https://github.com/satoshi-create/emakimono-next)

It explores how traditional narrative scrolls can be brought to life in a browser through horizontal scrolling, responsive design, and layered storytelling.

Now, as part of the [CANW](https://github.com/satoshi-create/complexity-and-network-webdesign) ecosystem,this project aims to **scale and expand the concept through the lens of complexity and network thinking** — turning cultural artifacts into emergent, interactive, and lifelike web interfaces.

---

## 🌱 CANW Perspective

We see picture scrolls not only as linear narratives, but as:

- Networks of scenes, motifs, and poetic references
- Systems of attention and gaze across time and space
- Cultural constructs rich in ambiguity and emergence

The goal is to turn the **horizontal scroll** into a canvas for complex storytelling,
where visual, interactive, and generative elements come together.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Reconstruct the horizontal emaki experience on the web
- Provide responsive, smooth horizontal navigation
- Use metadata structures (JSON or RDB) for narrative extensibility
- Explore ways of layering scenes, annotations, and meaning

---

## 🧪 Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

This MVP focuses on recreating the core viewing experience of an emaki in a modern browser.

### ✅ Features

- Scrollable horizontal image viewer (Next.js)
- Pre-sliced emaki images (`public/`)

---

## 📂 Structure

- `frontend/`: Next.js-based horizontal scroll viewer
- `backend/`: (optional) image API, annotation service
- `design-assets/`: Figma / Affinity designs, mockups
- `public/`: static image assets
- `docs/`: project goals, references, and concepts
