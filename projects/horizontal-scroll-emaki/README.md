# 📜 Horizontal Scroll Emaki

An experimental frontend project inspired by traditional Japanese emakimono (picture scrolls), reimagined as a horizontal scrolling web experience.

## 🎨 Origin: 横スクロールで楽しむ絵巻物

This project originated from an ongoing web-based experiment:

📂 GitHub：  
👉 [satoshi-create/emakimono-next](https://github.com/satoshi-create/emakimono-next)

It explores how traditional narrative scrolls can be brought to life in a browser through horizontal scrolling, responsive design, and layered storytelling.

Now, as part of the [CANW](https://github.com/satoshi-create/complexity-and-network-webdesign) ecosystem,this project aims to **scale and expand the concept through the lens of complexity and network thinking** — turning cultural artifacts into emergent, interactive, and lifelike web interfaces.

## 🎯 Goals

- Reconstruct the horizontal emaki experience on the web
- Provide responsive, smooth horizontal navigation
- Use metadata structures (JSON) for narrative extensibility
