# 📜 Horizontal Scroll Emaki

An experimental frontend project inspired by traditional Japanese emakimono (picture scrolls), reimagined as a horizontal scrolling web experience.

This project builds on the concept and implementation of  ["横スクロールで楽しむ絵巻物（emakimono!!）"](https://emakimono.com/en), a web-based experience that reimagines the traditional picture scroll (emaki) for the modern screen.

Now, as part of the [CANW](https://github.com/satoshi-create/complexity-and-network-webdesign) ecosystem,this project aims to **scale and expand the concept through the lens of complexity and network thinking** — turning cultural artifacts into emergent, interactive, and lifelike web interfaces.

## 🌱 CANW Perspective

We see picture scrolls not only as linear narratives, but as:

- Networks of scenes, motifs, and poetic references
- Systems of attention and gaze across time and space
- Cultural constructs rich in ambiguity and emergence

The goal is to turn the **horizontal scroll** into a canvas for complex storytelling,  
where visual, interactive, and generative elements come together.
