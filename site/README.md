# 🌐 CANW Web Site

This folder contains the source code for the **official website of CANW (Complexity And Network Webdesign)**.

The website is designed to:

- Present the project's philosophy and subprojects in a clear and inspiring way
- Serve as a hub for contributors, collaborators, and curious visitors
- Experiment with new forms of complexity-aware web design

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack (suggested)

We recommend using either:

- [**Astro**](https://astro.build) — lightweight, content-first, Markdown-friendly
- [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org) — powerful React framework with dynamic capabilities

> You’re free to rebuild or restructure this site! The structure should follow open and composable principles.
